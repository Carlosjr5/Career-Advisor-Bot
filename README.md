# Plan C: RAG Pipeline with LLM Model

This repository contains an experimental implementation of a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline using a Large Language Model (LLM). The pipeline is designed to retrieve relevant contents from the database and generate responses to given prompts. The performance of the pipeline is evaluated using the RQUGE metric.
Overview

The RAG pipeline with LLM model combines the strengths of information retrieval and natural language generation techniques. It leverages the retrieval capabilities of RAG to fetch relevant context passages from a knowledge source, and then utilizes the generative capabilities of LLM to produce coherent responses.
Components

The main components of the pipeline include:

    Retriever: Responsible for retrieving relevant passages from a knowledge source based on a given query.
    Generator: An LLM model that generates responses to prompts using the extracted information and context from the passages.
    Evaluator: Utilizes the RQUGE metric to evaluate the quality of generated responses against reference summaries.
