Initial Testing and Interaction
As you interact with the chatbot, observe its responses and behavior closely. This initial testing phase helps us grasp the bot's current capabilities and pinpoint areas for enhancement. 🔍

Editing NLU and Stories
📝 Now, let's collaborate on enhancing the chatbot's intelligence. Dive into the NLU and Stories scripts together. Add new intents, refine existing ones, and craft engaging conversational paths as a team. Let's pool our ideas and creativity! 🧠💡

Training the Chatbot
After making adjustments, ensure everyone is ready to run rasa train. This step is crucial as it retrains the model using our collective modifications, making the chatbot smarter and more responsive. 🚂📊

Group Testing
Once the training is complete, let's run rasa shell together to test our revamped chatbot! We can engage in conversation, share feedback, and iterate further as needed. 🚀🔄

With our combined efforts, we'll elevate our chatbot from a basic concept to a dynamic and effective communication tool. Let's collaborate, communicate, and innovate together! 💬
